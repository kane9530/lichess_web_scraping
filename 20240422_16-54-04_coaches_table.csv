Lebensjahr in einem Schachverein und habe vorher im Schulschach erste kleine Turniererfahrungen gesammelt . Ich hatte nie einen richtigen Trainer, auch wenn es einige Leute gibt, die mir viele wichtige Tipps f√ºr mein Spiel gegeben haben. In meiner Jugend habe ich das sehr bedauert und mich gefragt, wie gut ich wohl mit regelm√§√üigem Training geworden w√§re. Damit war der Weg des Schachtrainers vorgezeichnet. 2007 erreichte ich den Titel des Fide-Meisters und 2012 wurde ich schlie√ülich ein Internationaler Meister. ","Mein erstes Training begann 2001 aufgrund einer Wette. Der Nachbarsjunge spielte im selben Schachverein wie ich und hatte mit einem Freund gewettet, er k√∂nnte sich innerhalb von 2 Jahren von seinen knapp 1500 DWZ auf 2000 verbessern. Ich hatte zu der Zeit nicht soviel zu tun, trainierte ihn daraufhin mehrmals pro Woche und fuhr mit ihm zu Turnieren. Damals hatte ich nicht viel Ahnung vom Schachtraining, aber nach einem Jahr hat er knapp die 1800 DWZ erreicht, war also voll im Soll.

Er√∂ffnungstheorie ist heute leider nicht unwichtig, aber ich schaue immer, dass ich Varianten empfehle, die relativ schnell zu erlernen und zu verstehen sind.

I consider myself classicaly educated: You have to first be able to think inside the box before you think outside of it! ","After finding your strength and weaknesses we would develop your personal training plan for three months in advance. After we evaluate your progress and repeat. A typical lesson with me looks approximately like this: We look at the homework. We look at some examples of the topic we are talking about and I explain some rules of thumb. I suggest you to solve exercises based on the topic. You will get homework exercises with me. If you have played some tournament, we analyse games you play. Games take priority as I believe the best way to improve is detailed analysis of your own game.  ",FM

Improve your mental side of the game with a performance coach!,"['Espa√±ol, English (US)']",None,2094.0,2317,2253,None,None,"Hi! I'm Mateo, originally from Uruguay, where my journey in chess began at the age of six. Now residing in Madrid, Spain, I bring over 20 years of playing experience and a deep passion for the game. While my roots are in chess, my academic pursuits led me to study psychology, earning a bachelor's degree and later a master's degree in performance psychology. ","With over 20 years of competitive play, I've participated in numerous international and national tournaments, achieving remarkable results. Notably, I competed in nine Pan American Youth Championships, where I gained invaluable experience in the continent's toughest stage and even faced some of the later to become top talents in the world, like Caruana. I secured top-10 finishes twice, including a shared third place. ","Over the past three years, I've transitioned into coaching, leveraging my background in psychology and chess to support aspiring players in their pursuit of excellence. My coaching philosophy revolves around a comprehensive approach that integrates psychological principles with chess-specific strategies. Working closely with students, I've helped them achieve success in international competitions and attain norm-worth performances. Drawing upon my expertise as a performance psychologist, I provide personalized guidance to address each player's unique needs and challenges, fostering their growth and development both on and off the board.","In addition to my work in chess coaching, I've also served as a football coach, with a focus on professional development and high-performance training. Through my experience in football coaching, I've honed my leadership skills and gained valuable insights into player motivation and team dynamics. Furthermore, my involvement in esports coaching has provided me with a nuanced understanding of the mental aspects of competitive gaming, which share parallels with chess. These diverse experiences have enriched my coaching repertoire and equipped me with a multifaceted approach to supporting athletes in various domains.","As an avid -now informal- player, my forte lies in tactical prowess and imaginative gameplay, which gives me an extra understanding to help develop mental models around calculation with my clients. ","My coaching methodology is structured around short to medium-term training cycles, typically spanning two to three months, during which we focus on improving specific mental skills relevant to chess performance. These skills encompass areas such as pressure management, establishing effective routines, enhancing motivation, fostering self-regulation, bolstering self-esteem, and refining mental models. With a tournament-oriented approach, I guide students through a progression cycle, which includes assessment, skill acquisition, competitive application, evaluation, and adjustment. Emphasizing a collaborative coaching model, I work alongside players to develop and integrate mental skills into their chess progression journey, ultimately striving for excellence on the chessboard.",FM

I can then plan my lessons to target areas to improve, and build ones that are already strong.  This is done with game analysis, tactical exercises, strategical questions, how to think in chess, calculations, planning, middle game structures, numerous endgames, giving you a feel for how the pieces work together and individually, showing classical must-know situations that occur often.  I can help provide a solid basis for the different openings with either color, and teach other options besides the long, ""trendy"" theoretical lines, which are a little dry and overly used in my opinion.  That doesn't mean, however, I'm teaching a bunch of offbeat gambits and weird sacrifices, but just something to catch your opponent off guard with and get of the beaten path, fairly early.

I learned how to play chess at the age of 9 and since then I am a fanatic chess player. Due to the lack of my own family's interest and the lack of professional guidance it took me unnecessarily long to make progress. Still, my passionate spirit kept me going forward, and by the age of 15 I got my first Fide Master scalp over the board. My play at that time was not based on clear basics. Soon after struggling I realized that I did not understand why to do this and that. I lost some games without knowing the reason and was unable to find my own mistakes. I felt really disgusted by my own play so this painful experience led me to hire a coach. I learnt the basics, new ideas! In 2012 I won the V. Puspokladany Open. In mid 2017 I entered into the group of 2200s and I officially become a FIDE Candidate Master after competing in Budapest Spring Festival.

He trabajado muy duro para estar donde estoy y seguir√© trabajando para llegar mas lejos. Soy un gran partidario de que no se necesita un talento nato para llegar lejos en este deporte, ya que todo se basa en la forma e intensidad con la que ejercites tus habilidades ajedrecisticas. Si desea conocer mas de mi comun√≠quese a mi correo: michellopezabreu@gmail.com o a mi watsapp:+584129353635, yo responder√© amablemente cualquier pregunto o duda que tenga.","He participado en diversos torneos a lo largo de mi carrera ajedrecistica, obteniendo buenos resultados contra Maestros internacionales, maestros Fide, Candidatos a Maestros y Maestros nacionales tanto de mi pa√≠s como extranjeros . Sinceramente me costo mucho trabajo llegar a donde estoy y se que con trabajo duro y esfuerzo se puede hacer grandes cosas. En el a√±o 2016 logre colocarme en el podio del Festival centroamericano y del caribe 2016, logrando el tercer lugar (empatado entre el segundo y tercero) y as√≠ obtuve mi titulo de Maestro Fide, actualmente logr√© ganar campeonato panamericano Fisu am√©rica 2021 obteniendo el primer lugar y luego logr√© obtener el lugar de subcampe√≥n en el Festival de ajedrez Sim√≥n Bol√≠var 2022, d√≥nde estuvieron la selecci√≥n ol√≠mpica de mi pa√≠s (Venezuela).","Llevo 6 a√±os ofreciendo mis servicios de entrenador en lichess a diversos ajedrecistas de distintos pa√≠ses con resultados satisfactorios. Pienso que lo mejor de ser entrenador es ver el avance de tus alumnos, adem√°s es reconfortante tener una buena relaci√≥n alumnos-maestro. He tenido alumnos muy prometedores que hoy en d√≠a ya son jugadores bastante fuertes e incluso son entrenadores por la buena metodolog√≠a con la que hemos trabajado. Tambi√©n cabe a destacar que soy entrenador en distintas academias internacionales de ajedrez.","He sido alumno de diversos Maestros los cuales me ayudaron mucho durante mi progreso entre ellos est√°n: IM (Maestro Internacional) Jose Manuel Alvarez (Cuba), IM (Maestro Internacional) Leordis Quesada (Cuba) y IM (Maestro Internacional) Anibal Gamboa (Venezuela) los cuales me ayudaron mucho en mi desarrollo ajedrecistico. Al juntar todo lo que aprend√≠ con esos Maestros pude entender mucho de este hermoso deporte y me proporcionaron cierto nivel de metodolog√≠a para poder entrenar solo tranquilamente. ","Podr√≠a decir que mi fuerte en ajedrez y lo que mas me gusta de el es el juego posicional, el medio juego y los finales, los cuales me encanta ense√±ar ya que son partes del ajedrez que he estudiado  por varios a√±os.","Evaluare las fortalezas y debilidades del alumno mediante las partidas que ha jugado, al identificar dichos aspectos proceder√© a organizar un sistema de entrenamiento basado en sus debilidades, fortalezas, repertorio de aperturas (en caso que no tenga un repertorio de aperturas se asignara un repertorio basado en los gustos del alumno). Trabajaremos aspectos te√≥ricos, posicionales y t√°cticos de manera continua para fortalecer la visi√≥n del alumno. Revisaremos diversos tipos de partidas para enriquecer el conocimiento de aperturas y el calculo exacto de variante lo que ayudara a que el alumno vea lineas mas complejas y largas sin esforzarse tanto; ademas de que luego de cada sesi√≥n de entrenamiento le enviare un documento con todo lo visto en clase, esto sirve para fijar el conocimiento y poder repasar cualquier aspecto de la clase en cualquier momento sin perder la continuidad.",FM

I have played chess since I was  7 years old and hands down, it's the best game I have ever played. I am a quite tactical player  I love initiative and attacking(who doesn't ?). The later years I  have gotten a bit more positional, torturing your opponents in a position with an everlasting advantage is fun too(sadistic indeed). I am also a huge opening nerd and have many new ideas to bring to the table. It's important that my openings are objectively sound, and I will try to crush any opening that I deem not (like KID, Benko, Benoni, Dutch, Philidor, Modern defence and so on).","I started to play chess at my school when I was 7. According to my chess teacher I was not the best at the beginning, but  when I was like 9 I started playing tournaments. I remember playing chess with myself on a magnetic chessboard quite a bit so I think I was a bit obsessed :). At the age of 10,11,12,13, I won the Norwegian championships miniputt(u11) lilleputt(u13), kadett(u 16) and junior(u20) and have played in the Elite group since then. ","I have experience teaching players of all ages. I have thaught at schools, for my club, other clubs, the chess federation and chess coaching companies like Wallace Chess.

","In my private sessions I will usually look through the students games before the first lesson to get a picture of strength and weaknesses. I will also ask what the student wants to learn, goals and visions. what they think are their weaknesses. Getting better at chess is not a quick fix it takes time and effort. Perhaps the easiest way to get better at chess is to play a lot and analyze your games. So unless you are a very strong player already (and even then) you should do this. I will help the student giving my perspective and guide them into making better desicions on the chessboard. I also prepare positions from games, often my own or prepare openings  and more.",GM

Sono molto paziente e non ho problemi a spiegare le cose diverse volte o ad accettare critiche o consigli dagli studenti.","Come prima lezione sarebbe opportuno fare un incontro in cui si analizzano le partite recenti fatte dallo studente oppure per giocare con conseguente analisi e da l√¨ provare a capire quali sono le lacune e preparare un piano personalizzato a seconda dello studente. In alternativa sono disponibile per ogni tipo di richiesta specifica (apertura, finali, tattica, gioco posizionale). Insegno volentieri anche ai principianti concentrandomi sui principi del gioco piuttosto che sulla memorizzazione delle mosse.",FM

","I enjoy playing theoretical, tactical and attacking chess. My openings reflect this playing style, which include the Open Sicilian and the King's Indian Defense, both of which I have been playing for many years and played a big role in allowing me to score the aforementioned wins. ","I teach students through Discord, Skype, Zoom, WeChat, while using Lichess studies in order to explore different concepts. Instead of analysing student games in their entirety, I will often pick and choose specific positions that arise in games that are relevant to the content discussed during lessons.

My hobbies include sports such as football, sprinting and futsal as well as music composition and language learning. My teaching philosophy is grounded on the idea that chess development does not occur through collecting knowledge, but rather through acquiring skills. For coaching enquires please email me at jackpuccini99@gmail.com ","I started playing chess when I was 8 years old, and have since represented my country in multiple international events including U16 Olympiads and Junior World Championships. More recently, I won the Australian blitz championship in 2020. ","I have taught hundreds of students ever since I started teaching chess over 8 years ago, in both 1-on-1 and group settings. I have experience working with students over long periods of time to foster their chess development, which has led to some winning state championship titles.","I have previously given several chess lectures on topics ranging from attacking chess to psychology in chess, as well as more recently streaming instructive chess content on my twitch channel to many people. I also have experience as a chess commentator, commentating on events ranging from friendly matches to international tournaments. ","I believe that my biggest strength as a chess coach are the training methods that I have developed after years of thinking and experimenting that I would share with my students - from methods to more easily memorize opening lines and theoretical endgames, to improving your tactical vision. A sample of such methods can be seen on my YouTube channel - FM Jack Puccini Chess. I also have an abundance of chess resources, from opening files on various openings to self-collated endgame material to calculation-based training positions. ","Improving at chess is hard, especially as one reaches a more advanced level. Hence, if one wishes to improve they most likely will have to devote a fair amount of time to studying individually. This is why I believe the primary role of a coach should be to help the student help themselves. This firstly involves analysing the student's games to determine weaknesses that the student themselves cannot perceive, followed by providing content during lessons and homework to address such weaknesses. Of course, working with the student to build a reliable and sustainable opening repertoire is also a key goal, with the time being devoted to this depending on the student's current chess ability and level of ambition.",FM
