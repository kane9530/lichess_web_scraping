We generally analyze without the engine, although we might 'ask it a question' once in awhile: the engine is a valuable tool if you use it properly, but it's easy to misinterpret it! While analyzing the games, we look for patterns of mistakes, either due to the type of position or to the student's thought process. I usually teach lessons in sets of 4 so that we have the chance to do some lessons targeted towards a specific area, although I can be flexible with this. For example, if I see that a student is making many mistakes in the endgame, I would dedicate 1 or 2 lessons to the endgame. I would pick out a few instructive games for us to go over together",NM

I am a 22 year old IM from the United Kingdom. I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2021 and am currently pursuing chess full-time.,"I learnt to play chess when I was four years old, when my dad taught me the moves. After joining my local club in Maidenhead and playing several local tournaments, I moved up quite quickly to national age group tournaments. I was lucky enough to be picked for England to play at the 2007 World Youth Chess Championship, and have been privileged to play for my country many times at age group level. Two of my standout performances from my earlier years were finishing 5th in the under 12 World Youth Championship in 2012, and becoming under 18 British Champion in 2015.","I first started officially coaching in 2019, while a student at university. This took place online, and continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past 3 years I have gained significant experience and learned a lot about the most effective coaching methods. During this time, my students have seen great success, in tournament wins, rating gain, overall playing strength, and enjoyment of the game.","I have been involved in academic mentoring at various points throughout my life, and have been able to see the parallels between learning both in school and over the chessboard. These parallels have only been strengthened by my time at university, in which self-discipline and independent study are paramount.","There are parts of my opening repertoire that I have been playing for almost 15 years and would consider myself an expert in, for example the English Opening with White and the French Defence with Black. Over the last few years, my repertoire has broadened considerably. As for the rest of the game, I would say my greatest strengths are in dynamic, unbalanced positions where both good instincts and precise calculation are essential. I would regard calculation as the single most important skill to develop for any aspiring player to develop. A good calculation process benefits your play in all stages of the game, from early in the opening to technical, late-stage endgames.","I have generally kept to a schedule of weekly, 1-hour lessons with my students, although this can obviously vary and depends on the needs of the student. For each lesson, having a clear theme and lesson objective is key in order to maximise the effectiveness of the sessions. For each student, I will propose a few goals to achieve over a 1-2 month timeframe during our sessions. These goals are tailored to the student and will depend both on what the student wants, as well as what I feel are the most important areas to improve.
